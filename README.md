In This Data Visualization Job Simulation, An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and I need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Questions For CEO:

What are the total sales and profit margins for the last quarter?

What is the average lifetime value of our customers?

Are there any noticeable trends in customer purchasing behavior?

Questions For CMO:
Which customer segments are the most profitable and how can we target them more effectively?
What are the demographics and purchasing behaviors of our top customer segments?
